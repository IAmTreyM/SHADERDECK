# INCLUDED EFFECTS
### FILMDECK
A film emulation suite that attempts to replicate the real world workflow of color grading cinema film, from the scanning of the negative, grading the scan, to the film print. The successor to Film Workshop.
### FSR 1.0 2X
Fake supersampling using AMD's FSR 1.0 algorithm. This shader uses AMD's FSR 1.0 algorithm to internally upscale the image to 2X your render resolution, then downsamples that back down to your screensize. This is effectively a poor man's fake "supersampling."
